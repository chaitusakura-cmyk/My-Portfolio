## 🎨 Customization Tips

### Change Colors

The portfolio uses a professional blue color scheme. To change colors, edit these CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2563eb;      /* Main blue */
    --secondary-color: #0f172a;    /* Dark navy */
    --accent-color: #f59e0b;       /* Orange accent */
    /* ... more colors ... */
}
```

Use [ColorPicker.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) to find color codes.

### Change Fonts

The portfolio uses:
- **Playfair Display** for headings (elegant serif)
- **Inter** for body text (modern sans-serif)

To change fonts, update the Google Fonts link in `index.html` (line 10) and the font-family in `styles.css`.
